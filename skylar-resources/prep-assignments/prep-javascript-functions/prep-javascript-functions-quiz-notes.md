## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the five parts of a function definition?
  The 'JavaScript Functions Basics Guide' lists six parts of a function definition.
  I have provided two answers below as I am not sure which is the correct answer.

EXCLUDING KEYWORD
Part 1 is technically not part of the function. The five parts of a function definition are the:

1. Name (optional)
2. Parameters (optional)
3. Opening curly brace
4. Return statement (optional)
5. Closing curly brace

CONSOLIDATING BRACES
I have combined parts 4 and 6 to consolidate this list to 5 parts. The five parts of a function definition are the:

1. Keyword
2. Name (optional)
3. Parameters (optional)
4. Opening and closing curly braces
5. Return statement (optional)

- How do you call a function?
  You call a function using its name, in the format 'functionName(argument)'
- What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
  A parameter is used in the definition of a function, whereas an argument is what is passed to the function when calling it. An argument may become a parameter, depending on the function.
