- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
  The **condition** expression in the 'for' and 'while' loops is an expression that when true will iterate and when false will stop iterating.

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
  The **initialization** expression in a 'for' loop is evaluated once before the first iteration (if any) of the loop.

  The **condition** expression in a 'for' loop is evaluated once before each iteration of the loop.

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
  The **final expression** is evaluated after each iteration of the loop, before the next **condition evaluation** (if any) is evaluated.

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
  The **final expression** is usually used to update the value of the index variable.
