## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What data types can object properties hold?
  Any data type can be held in object properties
- Describe the syntax (structure) of object-literals in JavaScript.
  Object-literals are enclosed by curly brackets and consist of object properties and object methods.

Object properties are value pairs separated by commas. The value pairs are separated by a colon, with the name of the value to the left of the colon and the value itself to the right.

Object methods are functions defined by name. Like object properties, they are separated by commas and the function name is to the left of the colon, with the function itself to the right of the colon.
