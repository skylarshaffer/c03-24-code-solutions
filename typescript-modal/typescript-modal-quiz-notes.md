Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

  You display a modal dialog with the `showModal()` method of the modal DOM object.
- How do you hide a modal dialog?
  You hide a modal dialog with the `close()` method of the modal DOM object.
- What is the difference between the `showModal` & `show` methods?
