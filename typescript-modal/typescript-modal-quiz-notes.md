## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the `<dialog>` element used for?
  The dialog element is used for interactive overlays or pop-ups, modal or non-modal.
- How do you display a modal dialog?
  You display a modal dialog with the `showModal()` method of the modal DOM object.
- How do you hide a modal dialog?
  You hide a modal dialog with the `close()` method of the modal DOM object.
- What is the difference between the `showModal` & `show` methods?
  The `show()` method simply opens a pop-up but does not focus or restrict. The `showModal()` method focuses the modal, places it in the center of the screen, and restricts interaction with other page elements until closed.
