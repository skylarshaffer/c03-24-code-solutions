## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A function is a code block that can be called by name.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  A function definition is `function` followed by the name of the function, the parameters, and the code block encompassed by curly braces.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  A function call is the name of the function followed immediately by parentheses enclosing arguments (if there are any).
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  A function call does not have `function` before the function name, nor does it contain any of the code block from the definition.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is defined in a definition, while an argument is passed in a call.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  Function parameters allow for the output of the function to change based on input.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  A return statement ends a function and it outputs whatever is to the right of return.
- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  An arrow function is the name of the function followed by parentheses encompassing the parameters, and a right arrow **=>** pointing to the code block, either lacking return and in parentheses, or in curly brackets including beginning with return.
- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces, it is surrounded instead by parentheses. In concise body syntax, there is an implied return at the start of the contents.
