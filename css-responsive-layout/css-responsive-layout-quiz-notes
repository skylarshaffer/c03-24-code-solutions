## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?

  > In responsive web design, a **breakpoint** is a CSS px value at which selectors change to place content for viewing on different sized screens.

- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?

  > Percentage widths are preferred to pixel widths for a "column" class because they allow responsiveness within various breakpoint categories, so a column will always take up a certain percentage of the screen despite minor dimensional or browser-window size differences.

- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?

  > CSS rules for smaller `min-width` must come after styles for a larger `min-width` due to the CSS cascade and the lack of an upper limit on the smaller `min-width` rule. If both rules apply to a screen size, the rule that comes first in the cascade will take priority.
