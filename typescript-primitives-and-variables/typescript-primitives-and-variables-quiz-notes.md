## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of variables?
  Variables are used to hold data
- How do you **declare** a variable?
  You can declare a variable with an equals sign with the value on the right and the name on the left. Let or const are conditional and not always required.
- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
  You initialize a variable the first time it is declared. You do not necessary need to assign a value to a variable to initialize it, a variable may be undefined.
  CORRECTION:
  Initialize = assign a value. Undefined is not initialized yet, must be assigned a value. Future assignments are "reassignments".
- What characters are allowed in variable names?
  Standard english alphanumeric characters in addition to underscores (\_) and dollar signs ($) are allowed in variable names.
  ADDITION:
  Variable names may not start with numbers.
- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
  "Case sensitive" means that if there is any difference of capitalization between two variable names, such as variable **egg** and variable **Egg**, those variables will be treated as two different variables, not necessarily related to one another.
  BETTER ANSWER:
  Must be BOTH spelled and capitalized the same way. Only spelled the same way will be treated as different.
- What is the purpose of a string?
  A string stores text.
- What is the purpose of a number?
  A number stores a number and can be used for arithmetic and calculations.
- What is the purpose of a boolean?
  A boolean stores only one of two possible values, true or false.
- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?
  The '=' operator is used to assign values a variable.
- How do you update the value of a variable?
  You update the value of a variable by reassigning it.
- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
  Null is the lack of a value, but explicitly defined, while undefined is the lack of any assignment or definition.
  Null is 'this page intentionally left blank', undefined is a blank page.
  BETTER:
  Null is intentional lack of a value, undefined is unintentional lack of a value.
- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?
  Labels are important to include when you log values to the browser console so that the output is readable by others lacking the same knowledge of the code author.
- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.
  string
  number
  boolean
  null
  undefined
