## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  The purpose of a loop is to iterate a code block until a condition is met (conditional expression is now true or is no longer true).
  ALTERED
- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  The purpose of a **condition** expression is to provide an expression to evaluate against before each iteration, which then determines if iterations should continue.
- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  In the context of loops, an iteration is a single run of the dependent code block.
  CORRECTION:
  Every repeat of the loop.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  The **condition** expression of a 'while' loop gets evaluated before each iteration.
- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The **initialization** expression gets evaluated only once: at the start of the loop.
- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The **condition** expression of a for loop gets evaluated once before the first iteration and once after each final expression iteration.
  CORRECTION:
  Before each iteration is good enough.
- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The **final** expression of a 'for' loop gets evaluated after each iteration and is immediately followed by a **condition** expression.
- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  I can't find a straightforward answer from the linked documentation, but it seems that the answer is likely `break`.
  CORRECTION:
  Break
- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  The `++` increment operator adds 1 to the number to its left.
- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  You iterate through the keys of an object using a for in loop.
