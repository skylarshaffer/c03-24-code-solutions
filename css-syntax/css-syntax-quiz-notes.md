## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the names of the individual pieces of a CSS rule?
  A selector is followed by curly braces. Inside are declarations in property value pairs. Property and value are separated by a colon, and pairs are separated by a semicolon.
- In CSS, how do you select elements by their `class` attribute?
  You select elements by their class attribute with a period. For all elements with the attribute, you would use `.[className]`, for a class attribute of a specific element, you would use `[element].[className]`.

  You can select elements by their tag name by simply entering the tag name before the curly braces.
- In CSS, how do you select an element by its `id` attribute?
  You can select an element by its `id` attribute by prepending the attribute name with a `#`, like `#[idname]`. For a specific element's class attribute, you would use `[element]#[idname]`.
