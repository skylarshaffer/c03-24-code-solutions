## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are objects used for?
  Objects are used to hold properties and their associated values.
- What are object properties?
  Object properties are properties of objects. More specifically, they belong to the object and are nested within the object and must be accessed through the object.
  MORE CONCISE:
  Variables within an object.
- Describe object literal notation.
  Object literal notation is an alternative to standard object notation. It differs by replacing all of 'new Object()' with an opening and closing curly bracket.
  CORRECTION:
  Curly bracket, Property name, colon, property value, closing curly bracket.
- How do you remove a property from an object?
  You can remove a property from an object with the delete command (syntax: delete objectName['property']).
- What are the two ways to get or update the value of a property?
  You can get or update the value of a property with dot or bracket notation.
- What is the purpose of interfaces in TypeScript?
  Interfaces improve error detection and provide enforceable structure in TypeScript code.
- How do optional properties in a TypeScript interface differ from mandatory properties, and why are they useful?
  Optional properties are defined in their TypeScript interface with a ? immediately following the property name (before the colon). They allow properties to be added to associated objects without mandating the property's existence.
