## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are objects used for?
  Objects are used to hold properties and their associated values.
- What are object properties?
  Object properties are properties of objects. More specifically, they belong to the object and are nested within the object and must be accessed through the object.
- Describe object literal notation.
  Object literal notation is an alternative to standard object notation. It differs by replacing all of 'new Object()' with an opening and closing curly bracket.
- How do you remove a property from an object?
  You can remove a property from an object with the delete command (syntax: delete objectName['property']).
- What are the two ways to get or update the value of a property?
  You can get or update the value of a property with dot or bracket notation.
- What is the purpose of interfaces in TypeScript?
  Interfaces improve error detection and provide enforceable structure in TypeScript code.
- How do optional properties in a TypeScript interface differ from mandatory properties, and why are they useful?
  Optional properties are defined in their TypeScript interface with a ? immediately following the property name (before the colon). They allow properties to be added to associated objects without mandating the property's existence.
