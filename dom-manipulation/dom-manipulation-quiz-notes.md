## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the `className` property of element objects?
  The `className` property of element objects is a DOM property representing the CSS class attribute of the associated HTML element.
- How do you update the CSS class attribute of an element using JavaScript?
  You can update the CSS class attribute of an element using JavaScript by querying the associated DOM object to create a variable, and then by updating the associated property (className) of the new variable.
- What is the `textContent` property of element objects?
  The `textContent` property of element objects is the text between tags on the associated HTML element.
- How do you update the text within an element using JavaScript?
  You can update the text within an element using JavaScript by querying the associated DOM object to create a variable, and then by updating the associated property (textContent) of the new variable.
- Is the `event` parameter of an event listener callback always useful?
  The `event` parameter of an event listener is useful because it allows for specificity.
- Would this assignment be simpler or more complicated if we didn't use a variable to keep track of the number of clicks?
  This assignment would be more complicated if we didn't use a variable to keep track of the number of clicks because we would need to increment a string with each click.
- Why is storing information about a program in variables better than only storing it in the DOM?
  Storing information about a program in variables is better than only storing in the DOM because we can store in more value types than just string, and because we reduce the number of queries we need to run.
