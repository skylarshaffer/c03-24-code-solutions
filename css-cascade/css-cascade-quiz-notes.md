## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What are the four components of "the Cascade".
  The four components of "the Cascade" are:
  `Source order`
  `Inheritance`
  `Specificity`
  `!important`
- What does the term "source order" mean with respect to CSS?
  Source order means that CSS rules will be applied from top to bottom, and the lowest rulesets take priority over those above.
- How is it possible for the styles of an element to be applied to its children as well without an additional CSS rule?
  Inheritance. Nested elements inherit styles from ancestors.
- List the three selector types in order of increasing specificity.
  element
  class
  id
- Why is using `!important` considered bad practice?
  There are better ways to organize CSS and `!important` can create a nightmare of increasing importance.
