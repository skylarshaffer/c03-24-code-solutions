## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is destructuring, conceptually?

  > Destructuring is pulling apart something structured and segmenting it into independent and individual objects. It is like
  > sending kids to college.

- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?

  > ```javascript
  > {variable1: optionalAlias1, variable2: optionalAlias2} = objectWithPropertiesVariable1AndVariable2;
  > ```

- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?

  > ```javascript
  > [variable1: optionalAlias1, variable2: optionalAlias2] = arrayWithPropertiesVariable1AndVariable2;
  > ```

- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?

  > `Object` and `Array` literals use the object name and assignment operator (`=`) before curly brackets, and destructuring uses the assignment operator and the object name after curly brackets.
